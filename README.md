This project is submitted as part of my academic work.

I have studied this project from an open-source repository and
understood the implementation of CRUD operations using Java and JDBC.

Based on that learning, I have organized and documented the project
for academic submission.

Features:
- Book management
- Student records
- Issue & return system
- Database connectivity using JDBC
